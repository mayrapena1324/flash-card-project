 <p>I worked with a csv file and read it using Pandas. CSV file has the Japanese word with English translation. This app pulls the data from the CSV file and Tkinter dispays in on a flash card. After 3 seconds, the card will flip to reveal the correct answer. If you knew the word, you hit the check mark to have the app remove it from the CSV file. If you did not know the word, you click the X and the work will be added to words_to_learn.csv file.</p>
